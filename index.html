    <div class="Bio">
        <p>My name is Christine.  I enjoy being productive.  I love solving puzzles and learning new hobbies. I am very analytical and use m y meticulous nature to be thorough when working on a project.  
                I possess two degrees, one in Business Aministration, ad the second in Arabic studies.  I have studied computer network operations and am currently expanding my knowledge, learning to be a full stack Web Developer.</p>
        <p>
            In life, I believe it is not only important to be successful, but to be a genuinely good person.  <br> The following are rules to live by:
            <ol>
                <li>Everyday try to do something nice for someone even when no one is looking</li>
                <li>Strive for excellence regardless of the task</li>
                <li>Get, and stay organized</li>
                <li>Be kind, even when it's hard </li>
                <li>Be selfless</li>
                <li>Don't let success go to your head; be humble</li>
                <li>You are never too old for PB&J and chocolate milk</li>
                <li>In the process of growing up, don't forget to have fun</li>
                <li>Family is a top priority; be present in all aspects of the word</li>
                <li>In typing, there should be 2 spaces after a period</li>
            </ol>
